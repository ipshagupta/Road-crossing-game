The player has to reach the other side of a busy road without getting hit by any car.

## How to play
* The player (turtle) can only move in one direction: up, using the up arrow key.
* If the player is hit by a car, the game is over, and the player can start the game again from level 1.
* If the player reaches the other side of the road safely, the turtle goes back to the start from the next level.
* In each level up, the speed of the cars will increase.
